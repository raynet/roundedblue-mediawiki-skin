Rounded Blue was adapted for MediaWiki by Jennifer Elrod from the gorgeous Rounded Blue WordPress theme designed by Ghyslain Armand and shared with the community on itcouldbethisone.com. The first version of the RoundedBlue MediaWiki skin used the same image files and most of the same CSS that were used in the WordPress theme to create the rounded content and navigation boxes.

On 4/10/2010, RoundedBlue for MediaWiki was updated to fix the bug whereby the table of contents was breaking the layout. This fix entailed completely changing the images and CSS that create the rounded boxes. To edit the image files that are used in the latest version of the Rounded Blue MediaWiki skin, please do not attempt to edit the original PhotoShop files downloaded from itcouldbethisone.com.

The latest download of RoundedBlue for MediaWiki is available as a zip file under the Downloads tab on this site.
